Our class computer is a small classical CISC computer. This does not match any real computer. Rather it is a contrived example to get you to think about how to execute certain kinds of instructions. In doing so, it will make you think about the macro-structure of the CPU. In another word, what the programmer sees and the micro-structure, those components the programmer does not see. Note that some of the components the programmer (operator) might be able to see are not accessible by instructions.
